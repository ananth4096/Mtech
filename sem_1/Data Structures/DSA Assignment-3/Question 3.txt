The given code in this question is:
 
def Fun(test):
    if test < 0:  # Base case: If 'test' is 0 or negative, return 0
        return 0
    test_new = test + Fun(test - 1)  # Recursive call: Calculate the sum of 'test' and the result of Fun(test - 1)
    return test_new

test = 5  # Setting the initial value of 'test' to 5
x = Fun(test)  # Calling the Fun function with 'test' as an argument and storing the result in 'x'
print(x, end="")  # Printing the value of 'x', which is the result of the recursive sum

The output of the following code is 15.


First it checks the input is greater than zero. If it greater than zero, then performs recursion

fun(5) => invoked => 5 + fun(4) fun(4) => invoked => 4 + fun(3) fun(3) => invoked => 3 + fun(2) fun(2) => invoked => 2 + fun(1) fun(1) => invoked => 1 + fun(0) fun(0) => returns basecase 0

After that releasing from stack, prints output,

fun(1) => 0 + 1 = 1 fun(2) => 1 + 2 = 3 fun(3) => 3 + 3 = 6 fun(4) => 6 + 4 = 10 fun(5) => 10 + 5 = 1
So the output is 15.
